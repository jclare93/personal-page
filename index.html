        <p> In college I got my first coding experience, learning python to help with statistical analysis. Since then I have always been very interested in coding, and wanted to come back to develop those skills. 
	After graduating college (and before joining the Thinkful Software Engineering program), I taught in South Korea as a Debate and English  teacher for a couple of years. </p>
        <br>
	<p>I am willing and excited to interact with and work together with other people on any projects or software programs. If you ever need some extra coding help or just need 
	someone to bounce ideas off of-- please reach out and contact me below. </p>

        <p> Get to know me better! Some of my interests:</p>
